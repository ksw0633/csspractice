    <h3>deja vu</h3>
    <p class="dejavu">
        See your body into the moonlight
    Even if I try to cancel
    All the pictures into the mind
    There's a flashing in my eyes
    Don't you see my commission, the nation
    Has gone running again
    Can't you see now, illusions
    Right into your mind
    Deja Vu!
    I've just been in this place before
    (Higher on the street)
    And I know it's my time to go
    Calling you, and the search is a mystery
    (Standing on my feet)
    It's so hard when I try to be me, woah
    Whooooaaa!!
    Deja Vu!
    I've just been in this time before
    (Higher on the beat)
    And I know it's a place to go
    Calling you and the search is a mystery
    (Standing on my feet)
    It's so hard when I try to be me
    Yeeeaaaaaah!!
    See the future into the present
    See my past leaves in the distance
    Try to guess now what's going on
    And the band begins to play
    Don't you see my commission, the nation
    Has gone running again
    Can't you see now, illusions
    Right into your mind
    Deja Vu!
    I've just been in this place before
    (Higher on the street)
    And I know it's my time to go
    Calling you, and the search is a mystery

    It's so hard when I try to be me, woah
    Whooooaaa!!
