    <h1>Deja Vu</h1>
    <p>
        See your body into the moonlight
        Even if I try to cancel
        All the pictures into the mind
        There's a flashing in my eyes
        Don't you see my commission, the nation
        Has gone running again
        Can't you see now, illusions
        Right into your mind
        Deja Vu!
        I've just been in this place before
        (Higher on the street)
        And I know it's my time to go
        Calling you, and the search is a mystery
        (Standing on my feet)
        It's so hard when I try to be me, woah
        Whooooaaa!!
        Deja Vu!
        I've just been in this time before
        (Higher on the beat)
        And I know it's a place to go
        Calling you and the search is a mystery
        (Standing on my feet)
        It's so hard when I try to be me
        Yeeeaaaaaah!!
        See the future into the present
        See my past leaves in the distance
        Try to guess now what's going on
        And the band begins to play
        Don't you see my commission, the nation
        Has gone running again
        Can't you see now, illusions
        Right into your mind
        Deja Vu!
        I've just been in this place before
        (Higher on the street)
        And I know it's my time to go
        Calling you, and the search is a mystery
        (Standing on my feet)
        It's so hard when I try to be me, woah
        Whooooaaa!!
